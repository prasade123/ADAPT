Planning:
	• Involve team
	• Identify impacted stakeholder


Design:
	• Simple design

Build:
	• YAGNI: "You Aint Gonna Need It". Don't write code that you think you might need in future, but don't need yet
	• Build early and build often
	• Automate the build process
	• Pair programming
	• Refactor
	• DRY - Don't repeat yourself is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.


Test:
	• For unit tests (including test infrastructure tests) all code paths should be tested. 100% coverage is a good place to start.
	• Fail Fast
	• Have 100% regression suite
	• Automate testing

Deployment:-
	• Backout/forward strategy 
	• Continuous Integration
	• Continuous Delivery
